# 📂 Projects

## [🦠 Raptor's Game of Life *(Work In Progress)* - C++](https://github.com/ElRapt/raptor-s-game-of-life)

This repository contains my own C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway. The project aims to provide a fast and efficient simulation while adhering to modern C++ standards. It was mostly made to have fun with SFML and the language.

## [🤖 Global Slow Mode *(2023)* - Python](https://github.com/ElRapt/globalslowmode)

This project is a simple discord bot built in Python which allows server owners to add a shared "slow mode" in channels of their choice.
Each server it is present on has its own settings which persist in a database.
